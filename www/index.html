				<h2>the idea</h2>
			</div>

			<div class="subtitle">
				<p>When I moved to New York City in 2007, I hadn't thought much about the homeless. 
	I assumed if you didn't have a home, you were lazy or a vagrant.  I was annoyed 
	when they would panhandle on the subway or would repulse half a subway car for themselves.
	I saw people giving them money and would scoff to myself , "sure, buy him another bottle 
	of booze".</p>
    
    <p>
	I started working with <a class="services" href="https://sarajchipps.com/" target="_blank">Sara Chipps</a> in late 2008.  When 
	homeless issues came up she argued passionately for having compassion for the homeless.  Passionate
	in such a way I must be missing something.  She exposed me to all the reasons people end up homeless.
	I hadn't considered the effect of wars and childhood trauma result in choiceless homelessness.
</p>

<p>
	I would give small amounts to groups that walked through subway, passing out food, 
	and the street fundraising coin drives because it was convienent. I noticed the donation request 
	picked up around winter, bringing more awareness.  That seemed so impersonal and I didn't feel like
	I was actually helping.
</p>

<p><img class="picpadding" src="img/f-stop.png" alt="F-Stop NYC" align="right" width="300px">
	In winter 2009 I found a solution.  It was especially cold one night saw a regular.  I walked down the stairs 
	at the F stop Broadway/Layfette and found an older lady tightly	gripping her coat with her cane and coin cup 
	slightly quivering. I had never given directly to a homeless before.  I had approximately a $10 
	and a $1 MetroCard. I offered the $1 MetroCard and as she reached out to receive it, I realized this gift
	could not do anything for her.
</p>

<p>
	I retracted my offering and instead gave her with my $10 MetroCard and asked her to find someplace warm
	tonight, even if on the subway.  The look of appreciation in her eyes sealed my plan of action for 
	helping the homeless.  I would give them $10 MetroCards to ride the subway end to end or get to a shelter 
	they know about.
</p>

<p>	
	They can't use it for alcohol; they can't use it for cigarettes; they can't use it for drugs.  
	They could only use my donation for a subway ride.  I know it is a lateral subsidy for vices, but
	on slow nights, they could always get warm.

                    Why donate to me when you can directly donate to the homeless?  When the weather starts cooling and you pull 
                    out your winter coats, buy a $10 MetroCard and stick in one of the extra pockets you now have.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Next time you see someone you want to help, pull it out and give it to them.  Tell them it's a $10 card 
                    they can use to get out of the cold.  Be sure to wish the best for them.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I do take a limited number of donations each season.  I turn off donations when I have too many cards to distribute
                    and will return ungifted donations via paypal.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consider giving $10 MetroCard away directly.  It will feel good.
